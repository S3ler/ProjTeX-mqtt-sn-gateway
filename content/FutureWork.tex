\section{Future Work}
There is sill space for further improvements in this project. Some are for example:
Implement a MQTT-SN client on a constrained device.
Next could be to support more transmittion protocols like ZigBee and LoRa.
Support more platforms by implementing examples for windows, MBed or RTOS is also subtable.
Implement the missing MQTT-SN Gateway features like publishing with QoS 2 and updating will topic and will message.
Then implement missing functional tests for the missing features.
Add more automated testing like stress tests, for understanding were the limits of the design are and measure the used lines of code during the unit tests.
Enhance the test environment to even unit test the target hardware directly like a Arduino Board or a ESP8266.
Reduce the memory consumption to port the MQTT-SN gateway to Arduino Mega 2560 Board with a Ethernet Shield V1.
And last implement the BLESocket on a semi-constrained device using the Arduino Environment.
