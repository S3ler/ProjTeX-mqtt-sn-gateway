\section{Conclusion}
In this project paper we saw how to implement a aggregating MQTT-SN gateway for semi-constrained devices and which design decisions we need to take.
We use the Arduino Environment to be able to use a wide range of transmission protocol.
With the Core Components independent implementations we provide a basis to distribute the MQTT-SN gateway to nearly any environment.
The Linux implementation of the Core Components showed that UDP could be implemented straight forward.
The other interfaces are implemented using the arduino linux abstraction library to provide a maximum portability to the Arduino Environment.
Then we create a automated unit test and regression test environment to check our implementation.
Although not all tests are passing the gateway can be used with real MQTT-SN clients because it offers enough stable functionality.
Last we showed how the existing code is to extend when we want to support more transmission protocols.
We can say our project was a full success - we learned a lot about using the Arduino Environment and developing portable software for constrained devices using exchangeable implementations.
